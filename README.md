# LEUKEMIA-PREDICTION-USING-IMAGE-PROCESSING-TECHNIQUES
<h6>This study focused on WBC detection, RBC detection, and leukemia detection because it 
needs fast and accurate detection. In this mini project perform red blood cell (RBC) and 
white blood cell (WBC) counts using computer vision techniques through the OpenCV
library and Python programming language, and then determine whether a patient has 
leukemia or not.<h6/>


<p>This project was developed using Python 3. First, the required libraries were imported. The 
libraries used were,<p>

* OpenCV 
* Numpy 
* Tkinte
